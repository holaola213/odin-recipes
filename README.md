# odin-recipes

Hello! it's 09/14/25!
Not feeling too good today, was supposed to get a job lol!
I want to be able to put on the screen what I visualize in my mind by the end of this (ODIN)project (to a certain extent!).

Goals for this project:
1. Familiarize myself with setting up a website
2. Familiarize myself with git 
3. Learning when and how to committ to my repo
